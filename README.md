This is a project to create a single page application utilzing React bootstrap to evaluate the learning path during an internship at Mathison Projects.

The goal of this project is to utilize the Bootstrap UI framework layer and react-router to handle three different webpages.

With a due date of April 2nd, 2021, my goal is to commit and work on this project every day.
